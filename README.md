# Soccer_Player_Recommendation_Service

## Project Summaries

### Business Problem
* Nowadays, soccer players' market value contains a serious market bubble for many different reasons: inflow of oil money from the Mideast, high demand for specific players, and some special rules each league has differently, such as home-grown Quota.
* There is a specific period that teams can sign new players: the Summer and winter transfer market. Therefore, if the target player has already signed with another team, starting negotiations with other players on the list of similar players to the previous target player is crucial.
* There are many leagues in the world, and each league contains many teams, and each team contains many players. 
Spending time to make the list of target players is also a cost as a business aspect.
* For the detailed analysis of the players in the list, domain experts (player scouters) need a dashboard that presents details of players.

### Solution Strategy
* Build a recommendation system of similar players to the target players to be ready if the negotiation breaks down.
* Building the dashboard can support domain experts (player scouters) to help them build a better transfer market strategy.
